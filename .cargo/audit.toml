# RUSTSEC-2026-0001: rkyv vulnerability in Arc<T>/Rc<T> from_value on OOM
# This is an OPTIONAL dependency of rust_decimal that we don't enable.
# We only use rust_decimal's db-tokio-postgres feature, not rkyv serialization.
# The rkyv crate appears in Cargo.lock but is never compiled into our binary.
