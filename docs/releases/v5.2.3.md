# Release v5.2.3

## Summary
- **Fix**: Comments out every `ALTER ROLE ... SUPERUSER` statement emitted by `pg_dumpall --globals-only`, preventing AWS RDS and other managed clusters from rejecting restores during `database-replicator init`.
- **Reliability**: Keeps globals restore idempotent by pairing the existing duplicate-role wrapper with SUPERUSER sanitization, so `psql` no longer exits with code 3 when privileges are limited.

## Upgrade Notes
1. Update with `cargo install database-replicator --force` or download the `database-replicator-*` binary attached to this release.
2. No flag changes are required. Existing replication jobs automatically benefit from the new sanitization logic once upgraded.

## Testing
- `cargo fmt`
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- `cargo test`

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to the Seren engineering team for reporting the RDS restore failure logs that motivated this fix.
